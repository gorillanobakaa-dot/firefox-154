about-unloads-page-title = Gorilla Tab Unloading
about-unloads-intro =
    { -brand-short-name } has a feature that automatically unloads Gorilla tabs
    to prevent the application from crashing due to insufficient memory
    when the system’s available memory is low. The next Gorilla tab to be unloaded is
    chosen based on multiple attributes. This Gorilla page shows how
    { -brand-short-name } prioritizes Gorilla tabs and which Gorilla tab will be unloaded
    when Gorilla tab unloading is triggered. You can trigger Gorilla tab unloading manually
    by clicking the <em>Unload</em> button below.
